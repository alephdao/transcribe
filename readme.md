## About
This will take any audio file and give you a transcription of it using the Azure Speech API. Azure gives 5hr free/mo. And then it's only $0.18/hr after. 

Why use this? it's way cheaper than using a subscription service. 

## Use

Get your azure credentials (~5 minutes)

clone or download the repo (1 min)

pip install -r requirements.txt 

create .env file with your  azure info: 

AZURE_SPEECH_KEY = "your-azure-speech-key"
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION = "your-azure-region"

You're up and running!
